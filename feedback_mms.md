Overall:

I'm very impressed.  You did wonderful in the time you had.  I found a few areas that were unclear, but overall it's a nice codebase.  As we discussed, you were on the cleanup stage when you ran out of time.  It shows, but it's not glaring.  In the future, try to cleanup as you go along.  The "clean up" phase is elusive. You should be very proud of your work.
